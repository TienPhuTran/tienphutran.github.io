I am a Computer Science student with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science at the University of Houston. Experienced in developing machine learning models, particularly with TensorFlow, CNNs, and LSTMs for applications such as skin cancer detection. Proficient in multiple programming languages and frameworks including Python, TensorFlow, Java, C++, SQL, and web technologies. Adept at working in collaborative team environments and delivering innovative solutions in project settings.

Education
======
* Associate of Science Computer Science, Houston Community College, August 2020 - May 2020
* Bachelors of Science Computer Science, University of Houston, August 2023 - Fall 2025

Projects
======
* <span><strong>Skin Cancers Detection (Aug 2024 - Dec 2024)</strong></span>
  * Developed a skin cancer detection system using TensorFlow and various machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  * Applied image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training techniques to boost detection accuracy. 
  * Leveraged deep learning networks for feature extraction and classification, improving skin cancer identification in images.
  * Compared and selected results from different deep learning and machine learning models to identify the best-performing model for skin cancer detection.
  * <span style="line-height: 2.5em;"> Fine-tuned hyperparameters and applied validation techniques to ensure high accuracy in predicting cancers.</span>

* <span><strong>Online Clothing Store (Aug 2024 - Dec 2024)</strong></span>
  * Worked with a team of four to design and implement a responsive e-commerce website for an online clothing store.
  * Designed and developed a user-friendly interface with multiple filters for clothing products based on categories, sizes, and pricing using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React components.
  * Applied database technologies to manage user accounts, store data, and handle order processing efficiently.
  * Integrated real-time inventory management to enhance user experience.

* <span><strong>COVID 19 Detection (Jan 2025 - May 2025)</strong></span>
  * Using Pytorch, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, to build a COVID detection system with multiple algorithm methods.
  * Develop and implement customized CNN models and pretrained models. Apply preprocessing, transforming,
  and fine-tuning to optimize COVID-19 Prediction.
  * Customized CNN and pretrained models were applied to perform feature extraction. Implement LSTM and
  machine learning methods to predict COVID-19.
  * Compared results and optimized model layers and parameters.

* <span><strong>Approval System (Jan 2025 - May 2025)</strong></span>
  * Working as a team to build a submission approval system.
  * Submission System: Using Django and HTML/CSS to build a website for form submissions. Form data will be
  stored in PostgreSQL and retrieved for further actions such as adjusting or converting LaTeX to PDF.
  * Approval System: Using Django to build workflow rules to assign form reviews to sub-units based on the
  customized hierarchy. The review jobs can also be delegated to another person. Using HTML/CSS to build a
  dynamic website for employee feature.
  * Collaborating with another team to integrate and expand the service using Django and React.
